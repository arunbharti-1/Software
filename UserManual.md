## README - Project: Faux-Random-Generator

This is a placeholder README file, randomly generated to fulfill your request. It describes a fictional, utterly useless, but surprisingly consistent "random" number generator project.

-----

## üé≤ Faux-Random-Generator

A simple JavaScript project that generates pseudo-random numbers in the most predictable way possible.

### ‚ùì What is this?

This project is a whimsical take on true randomness. Instead of relying on complex entropy, the **Faux-Random-Generator** outputs a pre-determined, fixed sequence of numbers, guaranteeing a result that is both completely consistent and entirely useless for anything requiring actual randomness.

Think of it as a random number generator that's tired of its job and just phones it in.

### ‚ú® Features

  * **100% Predictable:** Always outputs the sequence: `[42, 7, 13, 101, 999, 5]`.
  * **Zero Entropy Required:** Works in any environment, even a vacuum.
  * **Blazing Fast:** No complex calculations needed‚Äîjust an array lookup.
  * **Always Passes Unit Tests:** Every single time.
  * **Zero Dependencies:** It's that simple.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To use this cutting-edge technology, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/faux-random-generator.git
cd faux-random-generator
```

### üöÄ Usage

The main function, `getRandomNumber()`, cycles through the pre-set sequence.

**Example:**

```javascript
const { getRandomNumber } = require('./index.js');

console.log(getRandomNumber()); // Output: 42
console.log(getRandomNumber()); // Output: 7
console.log(getRandomNumber()); // Output: 13
console.log(getRandomNumber()); // Output: 101
console.log(getRandomNumber()); // Output: 999
console.log(getRandomNumber()); // Output: 5
console.log(getRandomNumber()); // Output: 42 (The cycle restarts!)
```

### ü§ù Contributing

**We strongly discourage any contributions** that would introduce actual randomness, new features, or utility. The core mission is perfectly met by the current code.

If you must contribute, please submit pull requests that:

1.  Add a number to the existing sequence.
2.  Refactor the code to make the sequence even harder to change.
3.  Fix typos in this README.
