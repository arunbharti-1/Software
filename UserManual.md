# README - Project: Faux-Random-Generator

This is a placeholder README file, randomly generated to fulfill your request. It describes a fictional, utterly useless, but surprisingly consistent "random" number generator project.

## 🎲 Faux-Random-Generator

A simple JavaScript project that generates pseudo-random numbers in the most predictable way possible.

### ❓ What is this?

This project is a whimsical take on true randomness. Instead of relying on complex entropy, the **Faux-Random-Generator** outputs a pre-determined, fixed sequence of numbers, guaranteeing a result that is both completely consistent and entirely useless for anything requiring actual randomness.

Think of it as a random number generator that's tired of its job and just phones it in.

### ✨ Features

* **100% Predictable:** Always outputs the sequence `[42, 7, 13, 101, 999, 5]`.
* **Zero Entropy Required:** Works in any environment, even a vacuum.
* **Blazing Fast:** No complex calculations needed—just an array lookup.
* **Always Passes Unit Tests:** Every single time.
* **Zero Dependencies:** It's that simple.

### ⚙️ Installation

To use this cutting-edge technology, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/faux-random-generator.git
cd faux-random-generator
