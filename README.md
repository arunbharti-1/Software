# ‚öôÔ∏è Software Quality & Documentation Labs

This repository contains a series of laboratory exercises that apply modern software development and quality assurance practices to **technical documentation**. The project focuses on three core objectives: **collaborative version control**, **automated quality checks**, and **real-time co-editing**.

## üéØ Lab Objectives

### 1. Lab 1 ‚Äì Document Review and Version Control

**Objective:** To master **review-based documentation testing** by utilizing the formal collaboration features of **Git and GitHub**. This ensures documentation quality through structured, asynchronous peer review before content is approved.

| Key Action | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pull Request (PR)** | Formal mechanism for submitting content for peer review. |
| **Peer Review** | Assess documentation for **clarity, completeness, and consistency**. |
| **Merge** | Final approval and integration of quality-checked content. |

### 2. Lab 2 ‚Äì Automated Documentation Quality Check

**Objective:** To implement **automated quality checks** (spelling, grammar, style) directly into the documentation workflow. This ensures a consistent, high-quality standard is enforced automatically, saving manual effort.

| Key Action | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tool Installation** | Integrate a dedicated linter (**Vale, Proselint, or codespell**) locally or via **GitHub Actions**. |
| **Automated Run** | Quickly identify and flag errors against predefined style rules. |
| **Commit Correction** | Demonstrate the process of fixing automated issues before final submission. |

### 3. Lab 3 ‚Äì Collaborative Document Writing

**Objective:** To gain practical experience with **real-time collaboration tools** and understand how to integrate their final output into a standard Git repository for long-term version control.

| Key Action | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Simultaneous Co-editing** | Test the real-time merging capabilities of tools like **Google Docs or HackMD**. |
| **Observation** | Document how the tool handles **version conflicts** without manual merging. |
| **Export & Push to GitHub** | Connect the final, real-time deliverable to the established **version control system**. |
